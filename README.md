This game is a simple take on the classic Frogger Aracade game. It is based in JavaScript. This project was created as part of the [Udacity Front-end Nanaodegree] program.


## Game Play
 This is a one player game. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemy bugs. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies will move at varying speeds but only on the paved block portion of the scene. When the player collides with an enemy, the player moves back to the starting block. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

 Players have the option to select their character before the game starts and change their selection at any time during game play.

 Download the [zip] from GitHub or clone from the repository
