This game is a simple take on the classic Frogger Arcade game. It is based in JavaScript. This project was created as part of the [Udacity Front-end Nanaodegree] program.


## Game Play
 This is a one player game. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemy bugs. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies will move at varying speeds but only on the paved block portion of the scene. When the player collides with an enemy, the player moves back to the starting block. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

 Players have the option to select their character before the game starts and change their selection at any time during game play.

## Installation

 Download the [zip] from GitHub or clone from the repository
 ```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/katriJS/fend-prjt-arcade-game.git
 ```

## Instructions

Open index.html in your browser of choice to begin playing the game.

You can select your Character at the beginning of the game from the Player Section Menu or you can skip this step by clicking the 'Skip' button or by clicking anywhere outside the menu. If you do not select a
character, the default character will by assigned. You may change your character selection at any time by standing on the Star Selector while pressing the SPACE bar on your keyboard.

Use your keyboard arrow keys to navigate your character around enemies to reach the water. The game is won when you successfully reach the water without being hit by an enemy bug. If you are hit by an enemy, the game will reset and you will have to begin from the starting position again.
